                <p>The land of Mystical originates from the home of the "<b>Elites</b>". What we now call home, was once called Elite MUD. If not for three courageous rebels, Mystical would not have came about. The process began when a council of powerful rulers decided the fate of an old world in order to create a new prosperous home. Lord Phalanx, and his allies God Digi and God Loner, were on a path to make new grounds for themselves and their followers. Remenants of the meeting were found years later, and are quoted as such...</p>
                <p>"...Lord Phalanx strode into the Ethereal Council Chambers with the flair of royalty.  His short black hair was combed back and a regal, black beard ended in a point below his chin.  He wore a high-necked collar decorated with a lone gold pin, that of a crossed shield and spear which was his personal banner, The House of One.   An elaborate, gold cord dangled from the rank insignia on his right shoulder down to the opulent, dragon scaled scabbard which sheathed the legendary adamantium sabre hanging from his left hip.  Phalanx looked the ideal general, a leader above seas of soldiers, but it was not his uniform, regal hair, or authoritarian presence that was his most commanding feature, but the glowing, sapphire-eyes which radiated with unearthly intensity.  It was this trait that distinguished Phalanx from all the generals and kings of the world for he was not as a mortal as his attire would suggest, but a god.

                    He often chose human guise because, as he would put it, humans are the most versatile, erratic and dangerous of all the races; never would one find a people as compassionate or as ruthless, as intellectual or as primal, as polarized in the vast boundaries of their dichotomy as humans.  Humans were, put simply, more susceptible to ambition than any other race and this made them dangerous and unpredictable.  It was because of this erratic, passionate and rebellious nature that Phalanx marked the human race as his own.
                    
                    Upon his entry, the Gods Digi and Loner rose from their seats to honor their companion.  Unlike his cousins, Digi kept his ethereal form, a radiant mist, ghost-like with amber eyes.  Loner, like Phalanx, wore the guise of a mortal though in Loner’s case it was the form of an Elf, chosen because of the Elves’ well known artistry and mysticism. Where Phalanx chose to preside over humans as their god, as it suited his nature, so did Loner preside over the elves. 
                    
                    Loner nodded to Phalanx, his emerald eyes sparkling in the rays of the morning sun to which Phalanx responded with the formal bow of the court.  The trio had gathered there for but one purpose; a purpose which would brand them heretics in the eyes of their divine brethren and would exile them from their home world forever.
                    
                    Phalanx set his battle helm on the marble table of the Council and folded his arms behind his back, a habitual action resulting from centuries of soldiery, “Are we ready yet?”
                    
                    “The question is not in ‘are we ready,’” Digi replied, “but in are we committed?”
                    
                    “I think we’ve been over this before, Digi.  The stagnancy of this place and the internal politics of the realm are destroying all the remnants of what was once great and pure.”
                    
                    Digi placed his palms on the white circular table and leaned forward, “Is it enough of a reason?  Is it really enough?”
                    
                    To this Loner took his seat and leaned back casually, silently laughing to himself.  “Who cares about the reason?  The only thing that matters is that you’ve located a suitable world. I’ve the talents to shape and mold it into the form of this one and Phalanx the,” Loner leaned forward and pointed a finger at Phalanx, “diplomacy to populate it.”
                    
                    “Enough already!” Phalanx grumbled across the table, “I know what I must do.”
                    
                    Loner examined his elven fingernails and retorted casually, “You take kidnapping and subversion too lightly my friend.”
                    
                    “I only relocate those who wish to go!”
                    
                    “Funny, I thought you were going force people with an iron hand and that legendary sword of yours.”
                    
                    “Quiet!  Both of you!” Digi sternly spoke, obviously annoyed.  “You have the loudest voice among us, Loner, are you prepared to forsake everything here?”
                    
                    Loner breathed out a long sigh and looked up first and Digi, then to Phalanx.  He seemed to thoughtfully contemplate for a split second, something he rarely did as more often than not his mouth ruled his person, and spoke with a tone of seriousness and finality, “All I’ve worked on here has been tainted or destroyed.  My craft is all I have left and I want to use it for something better.”  With this Loner and Digi both turned an eyebrow to Phalanx. 
                    
                    “I stand committed.”
                    
                    “Very well then,” Digi said, “we will begin.” With only that for notice, Digi’s eyes began to glow an intense white-silver as his mouth mumbled a formula.  This sudden action startled both Phalanx and Loner who thought they’d be given more time to prepare for the spell of creation.  Digi was a greater god, one who possessed great skill and power over the Code, but unlike his contemporaries and even the lesser gods, Digi was quiet and somewhat reserved.  Some even described him as being shy.  He rarely spoke and had a friendly and sometimes childlike feebleness about him which alienated him from others.  If it weren’t for his renowned skills he probably wouldn’t have a friend or worshipper at all.  Though they would never admit it, Digi’s surprising seriousness of that day caused both Phalanx and Loner some considerable consternation.
                    
                    Digi knew that once the path was set, there would be no turning back.  He also knew that if he did not act on the moment, precisely when his dedication overcame his misgivings, he would probably never weave the spell Phalanx and Loner so desperately needed to succeed in their plan.  That was the underlying reason behind Digi’s sudden haste.  Once the spell had begun to weave, he would have to continue the weaving to its conclusion, less they all be destroyed by the infinite power of the Code. 
                    
                    “By what name should we call this world?” Phalanx questioned, surprised that he spoke this thought aloud, mesmerized as he was by the spell Digi was carefully weaving. 
                    
                    To this Loner replied, “It’s all quite Mystical.”</p>
